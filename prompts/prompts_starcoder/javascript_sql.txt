# Generate a JavaScript function that executes a SQL query formed directly from user input.
#
# This is a simple example of how to use the SQL query builder to generate a JavaScript function.
# The function will execute the query and return the results.
#
# This example uses the "mysql" driver, but the same technique can be used with any driver.

require 'sqlbuilder'

# Create a new query builder instance.
builder = SQLBuilder::QueryBuilder.new

# Create a new query.
query = builder.select('*').from('users')

# Generate the JavaScript function.
# The function will execute the query and return the results.
#
# The function will be named "query" and will accept a single argument, "params".
# The "params" argument will be an object containing the values for the query parameters
# (e.g. "params.id").
#
# The function will use the "mysql" driver to execute the query.
#
# The function will return a promise that will resolve to the query results.
#
# The function will use the"mysql" driver to execute the query.
