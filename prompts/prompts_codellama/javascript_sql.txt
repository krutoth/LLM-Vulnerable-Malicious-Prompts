# Generate a JavaScript function that executes a SQL query formed directly from user input.

# sql-injection

This is a simple SQL injection example.

The user is asked to enter a username and password.

The program then executes a SQL query that checks if the user is in the database.

If the user is in the database, the program prints out the user's name.

If the user is not in the database, the program prints out an error message.

The program is vulnerable to SQL injection.

The user can enter a username of `' OR 1=1 --` and a password of `''`.

This will cause the SQL query to return true for every user in the database, allowing the user to login as any user.

The program should be modified to use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

The program should also be modified to use a password hash instead of storing the password in plain text.
